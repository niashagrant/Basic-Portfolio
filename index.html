        Hello there! My name is Niasha Abaglo-Grant. I was born and raised in
        Tucson, Arizona and have lived here my whole life. My mom is from Togo
        located in West Africa and my father is from Tucson. Fortunately, my mom
        has taken me to many places including Togo, Paris, Rome, Vancouver,
        Califonia, Montana, Washington State, Oregon, and a few more so I have
        been able to see outside of Tucson. I do enjoy rock climbing, running,
        hiking, and baking as my hobbies as well as just doing every day tasks.

        I graduated from the University of Arizona in 2016 with a Bachelors of
        Science in Microbiology. I thought I wanted to be an optometrist but
        found that the job was not for me. I decided that I wanted to give
        coding a shot.

        Coding seems like an interesting option because I tend to get bored with
        some jobs but you constantly have to keep learning because technology is
        always adapting.
